    Hi! My name is Jason Zhu, and I'm a current senior at Stanford University studying pursuing a B.S in Mathematics and a coterminal M.S. in Computational and Mathematical Engineering. I'm originally from Texas but currently based in the East Coast working remotely as part of Stanford's Management Science and Engineering Undergraduate Research program.

    My academic interests are broadly in applied math, numerical analysis, and probability theory. Previously, I've done work in various research programs at Stanford such as SURIM and CURIS. Some of my previous projects include work with high dimensional tensor decompositions and deep learning with computer graphics. My most recent work involves the simulation and statistical estimation of a certain class of stochastic processes called max-stable random fields.

    Aside from academics, I play classical piano and dance with Stanford's Common Origins dance team! I also speak four languages, including English, Spanish, Mandarin Chinese, and Hokkien.
